<h1>Draven...what is this Repository? </h1>
This repository is aimed at created my proffesional blog. I will include all of my developer work related to school, work, and recreational activites. To make sure this blog has plenty of content, I will also be including almost every life event.

I <strong>GREATLY</strong> encourage everyone to contribute thier feedback on ways I can improve this blog and my general coding.
We're talking, caPitilization error, punctuation error; life error (Just kidding), simplifying code, changing code, formating code, and many more. I'll say this again and again, because I <strong> GREATLY </strong> appreciate any and all feedback!
